    <li>The project will be broken into <strong>2 phases</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase I</strong> has only one part: <span class='red-span'>The Founder Token</span>. 
    <br />
     There will only be 1,000 tokens minted in this phase whose main utility is that 1 founder token can redeem 1 WSW NFT without forfeiting the Founder Token itself. The Founder Tokens may have more to offer in the future for our first wolves launched into the wild…</li>
    <li><strong>Phase II</strong> consists of 4 rounds: The Founder Token.</li>
    <li>The <span class='red-span'>first round</span> is where the initial 1,000 tokens will be redeemed for the wolf NFTs. <span class='red-span'>Rounds 2 and 3</span>, will be where 2,500 Wolf NFTs are made available for sale. <strong> The Wolflist </strong> will have 24 hours to mint and then whatever is left (if any) will be opened up for the public sale. <span class='red-span'>Round 4</span> will have 4,000 Wolves available and this will be the last round. <i> It will mint the same as the previous rounds; Wolflist then public sale.</i> 
    <br /> Round amounts are subject to change based on our progress through the end of the year, but the total will always be 10,000.</li>

    <li><strong>Two main things</strong> separate us from other projects.</li>
    <li><span class='red-span'>First</span>, we are one of the first projects to fractionalize NFTs to give all holders a share of what we invest in.</li>
    <li><span class='red-span'>Second</span>, we are thrilled to have our community engaged in EVERY move our project makes by teaching the wolfpack how we make our investment choices.</li>
    <li><strong>What does this mean?</strong> Understanding the prowess that is taken during each step of the hunt. That means not only being able to eat the meat and reap the rewards from the vault, but learn how to hunt on your own and become an Alpha Wolf.</li>
