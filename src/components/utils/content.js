      content: `The project will be broken into 2 phases.
      \n Phase I has only one part: The Founder Token. There will only be 1,000 tokens minted in this phase whose main utility is that 1 founder token can redeem 1 WSW NFT without forfeiting the Founder Token itself. The Founder Tokens may have more to offer in the future for our first wolves launched into the wild…Phase II consists of 4 rounds: The Founder Token.The first round is where the initial 1,000 tokens will be redeemed for the wolf NFTs. Rounds 2 and 3, will be where 2,500 Wolf NFTs are made available for sale. The Wolflist will have 24 hours to mint and then whatever is left (if any) will be opened up for the public sale. Round 4 will have 4,000 Wolves available and this will be the last round. It will mint the same as the previous rounds; Wolflist then public sale. Round amounts are subject to change based on our progress through the end of the year, but the total will always be 10,000.`

      but as the pack grows we will make it more challenging to secure a spot on this list every round.`
