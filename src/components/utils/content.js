    <li>The project will be broken into <span class='faq-black'>2 phases</span>.</li>
    <li><span class='faq-black'>Phase I</span> has only one part: <span class='faq-red'>The Founder Token</span>. There will only be 1,000 tokens minted in this phase whose main utility is that 1 founder token can redeem 1 WSW NFT without forfeiting the Founder Token itself. The Founder Tokens may have more to offer in the future for our first wolves launched into the wild…</li>
    <li><span class='faq-black'>Phase II</span> consists of 4 rounds: The Founder Token.</li>
    <li>The <span class='faq-red'>first round</span> is where the initial 1,000 tokens will be redeemed for the wolf NFTs. <span class='faq-red'>Rounds 2 and 3</span>, will be where 2,500 Wolf NFTs are made available for sale. The Wolflist will have 24 hours to mint and then whatever is left (if any) will be opened up for the public sale. <span class='faq-red'>Round 4</span> will have 4,000 Wolves available and this will be the last round. It will mint the same as the previous rounds; Wolflist then public sale. Round amounts are subject to change based on our progress through the end of the year, but the total will always be 10,000.</li>

    rounds on our website during our initial sale and on OpenSea thereafter. If successful, 
    a randomly selected Wolf will be minted on the Ethereum blockchain and sent to the wallet you connected and purchased with.`

    content: `<ul>
    <li><span class='faq-black'>Two main things</span> separate us from other projects.</li>
    <li><span class='faq-red'>First</span>, we are one of the first projects to fractionalize NFTs to give all holders a share of what we invest in.</li>
    <li><span class='faq-red'>Second</span>, we are thrilled to have our community engaged in EVERY move our project makes by teaching the wolfpack how we make our investment choices.</li>
    <li><span class='faq-black'>What does this mean?</span> Understanding the prowess that is taken during each step of the hunt. That means not only being able to eat the meat and reap the rewards from the vault, but learn how to hunt on your own and become an Alpha Wolf.</li>

    Each hunt will have a timeline where at the end our wolves gather for The Grand Feast.

    For example, 6 months, or when we triple the meat we have, whichever comes first.`

    <li><span class='faq-black'>Staking</span> is where NFT holders <span class='faq-red'>“lock”</span> their NFT away and earn tokens based on how long they are staked as well as how many they have staked. Staking our NFT will yield $WSW tokens per day per NFT staked. There will be a few NFTs in the entire collection that will yield a higher return of $WSW… keep your eye out!</li>
    <li><span class='faq-red'>Note:</span> staked NFTs must be unstaked before they can be sold on secondary markets. <span class='faq-red'>But would you really want to leave the pack?</span></li>

    $WSW holders will be able to swap their tokens for $ETH.`
